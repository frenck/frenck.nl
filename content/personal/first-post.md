## Do what is great!

Here we go! :tada: This post marks the official launch of my website! :rocket:

On March 24th of 2018, I have sent out a [tweet] on my Twitter account writing
about my current plans for my personal home automation project. It included an
image showing all kinds of IoT devices I'm planning to use in my project.

It didn't take long for [Andy Cowan][andy-cowan] to reply to it...

I love Twitter and always reply, so I wrote:

OK, honestly, I had not considered the option of starting a blog/website on
this subject. And actually, I did not have a personal site at all. I did
launch a blog on my personal domain in the past (years ago). But it was
missing focus, and lacking a specific niche. Those kinds of blogs are doomed
to fail and never keep up. So did mine at the time.

You know what Andy, you are absolutely right my friend! So I dug up my
personal domain, created a small system for this website and voila!

I already have tons of ideas for articles to write. Nevertheless, I'm dying to
know what you would like to read...? Please let me know in a [reply] on this
blog or tweet :smile:

Thank you, Andy, for giving me a focus for my personal website, it fits me
perfectly! Today I decided to do what is great; writing about my home
automation adventures.
