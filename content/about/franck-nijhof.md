How nice of you to drop by and showing an interest in my human existence
:blush:.

I'm Frenck, and I mainly write about the IoT (Internet of Things) and Home
Automation :house_with_garden:. Come with me on my domotics adventure that
turns my house into a real smart home that, most importantly,
meets all the WAF (Wife Approval Factor) guidelines and
scores high WAR (Wife Approval Rate) scale :ok_woman:.

I use Home Assistant as my home automation system, which is built with the
Python3 programming language and allows you to tie an amazingly amount of IoT
devices together. The best part of it, its open source, and you can smoothly
run it on a cheap Raspberry Pi.

If you are still reading, the chances are that you are probably interested in
the "howto" part of this all. Don't worry, I'll provide tutorials on different
subjects, like z-wave, lighting automation :bulb:, and presence detection. Other
types of things; Sharing of my configurations, stories about contributions I
make to the open source community, and along the way, I'll do some reviews on
IoT hardware.

I have 30 years of programming experience, in many languages, and working as
software & DevOps engineer in my day to day job. In my private time, I'm using
this experience to work on the Home Assistant project. I like to give
back my knowledge and time to the open source community. You might have found
me via one of the many add-ons I've created for the Home Assistant operating
system: Hass.io. My Hass.io add-ons are probably the most downloaded and used
add-ons in the world.

I also have a personal life (yeah really!). I live in Enschede, a city in the
east of the Netherlands, I'm a father of a 5-year-old baby girl :girl:,
a 1-year-old big boy :baby:, and engaged to the love of my life :couple_with_heart:. 

I'm a nerd and proud of it. It is my hobby, which I turned into my profession
while maintaining it as my hobby. As a nerd, I do have some other interest,
which may pop up on my site from time to time. For example, things like:
encryption, programming in general, GPG/GnuPG/OpenPGP :lock:, and maybe I'll
throw in something personal from time to time.

Hoping you are enjoying my site, and please, feel free to contact me any time!
:punch:
